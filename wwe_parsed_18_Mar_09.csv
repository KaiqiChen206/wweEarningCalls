"george barrios","George","george barrios","World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.","CFO"," Thanks, Ian, and I thank everybody for coming today. Before I get started, I will be making several forward-looking statements today as part of our discussion. These statements are based on management's estimates. Actual results may differ from current expectations due to numerous factors. To the extent that any non-GAAP measures are referenced during the discussion, reconciliations to be GAAP measures can be found on our website, corporate.WWE.com, or in our SEC filings. Today what we will do, we'll cover a quick introduction of WWE, the business model, what we see as the investment thesis and try to leave a little bit of time for Q&amp;A at the end. Essentially, our competitive advantage, if you will, resides on three platforms. Number one, we create original content and we own that content, and it gets consumed by a passionate global fan base. Two, we consider ourselves a very innovative marketing enterprise. In addition, we have one of the most powerful marketing channels available to anyone, which is currently five hours of prime time TV in the US, and a program that is seen in 140 countries and 28 languages. And that five hours of prime time will be going to six hours of prime time in a couple of months, and I will touch on that in a little bit. And third, we are able to distribute this original content, which we own, and leverage it very effectively across a variety of platforms, which I will touch upon. Our TV, our pay-per-view live event, consumer products platforms, as well as across a variety of geographies. We see attractive long-term growth for the Company because of that global fan base and because of the ability to distribute across platforms and geographies. And we have a current dividend policy of $1.44 a share for our public shareholders, $0.96 for the B shares, which are the family shares. Everything for us starts with our TV. Our programs, our broadcasts in 28 languages to more than 145 countries. And in the US, we reach about 15 million viewers. We consider ourselves network makers, or content network makers. Every show is number one in the US on the channels in which it plays. So our RAW show, which has been on the air for 15 years and is currently on USA, is the number one show on USA. Our Friday night SmackDown show, which is currently on MyNetworkTV and plays on Friday nights, is the number one show for MyNetworkTV. And then ECW is the number one show for Sci Fi. An example of the strength and of our ability to make networks was pretty recent. Up until September of last year we were on CW. We were the number one show on CW. As that deal was coming to an end, we had an open bidding for the show, ended up partnering with MyNetworkTV, and we quickly became the number one show on MyNetworkTV. As I mentioned before, we are currently at five hours of prime time TV, 21 hours total, including replays, on a variety of channels. We will be going to six hours of prime time TV in April. And it's a real -- it's a great example of how the content gets created once and leveraged. We signed a deal with WGN. We announced that last year. So starting in April, on Thursday nights at eight o'clock, there will be a new show, WWE Superstars, which will take content from our three brands -- RAW, SmackDown, ECW, put it all in one show. That will be the only place where a fan can see all three brands interact. We will have unique story lines on that show. From an economic standpoint, very little in incremental production costs. The show gets filmed at existing shows, so there was no additional really additional production costs for us. However, the license fees then translate very well on the P&amp;L. TV is at the core, and those brands are the core -- RAW, SmackDown and ECW. But we also have a lot of other ancillary brands, starting with our talent. We have 160 superstars that interact and drive pop-culture. This leads to a lot of sponsorships, both for the company and for the talent. Some of the current sponsorships -- Gillette, Subway, Castrol. John Cena, who is probably the number one talent in the WWE, has a partnership with Gillette, whose commercials you see all over TV, a lot on NASCAR events. We talked about TV. Our TV networks are among the most watched. We are viewed more than regular-season basketball, regular-season baseball and regular-season hockey. On the live events side, we had more than 2 million fans at over 300 events in 2008. And WrestleMania 24, which took place in Orlando last year and had over 74,000 fans, which is more fans than what the Super Bowl drew last year. In addition, for any locality where WrestleMania plays, it is an incredible economic boon to the city and surrounding locations. And last year, the city of Orlando said that it generated more than $50 million in revenue for the community. Consumer products -- we have a variety of brands there. Even though we are scripted entertainment, our DVDs get lumped in the sports category. And out of our 30 releases in 2008, we had 13 that released at number one. Our video game was the 13th best-selling video game in 2008. That is SmackDown versus RAW. And to date, since its inception, which is about eight years now, SmackDown versus RAW has sold over 43 million units. Online, our Internet traffic exceeds industry peers. We have more page views than NBA.com, NASCAR.com and MTV.com. And we were the second most searched entity on Yahoo! search. This clip will give a nice view of how the brand plays. (Video plays) One of the things I always tell people is, you can look at the numbers, you can hear about the story and it gives you a good flavor for what the economics are of the Company, its cash generating potential, the investment thesis. However, if you really want to get a sense for the power of the brand, I'd encourage anybody to go to a show. What you saw there was pretty representative of the energy and the passion that you see. Also, about the demographics of the audience and how it's -- while it skews male, there's a lot of female, primarily because of the family nature of the entertainment. Kids are going, so their moms are taking them. So I always encourage people, if you get a chance, we tour all across the US. There's a show coming near you to avail yourself of that. You really get a good sense of that passion, which then drives the circle on this slide. Our business is multi-platform. I will start in the upper right-hand corner. Our live events business generated about 24% of the $526 million in revenue in 2008 for the Company. About 240 shows in North America, about 75 to 80 shows internationally. One of the interesting things the Company has done in the last few years is increase its international touring from about 30 events to the 75 to 80. International has secularly more powerful economics. The average ticket price, it's about double what it is in the US, and the average attendance is about 50% higher than it is in the US, primarily because of the supply and demand. So we will do 250 shows in the US; we do only 75 to 80. In some cases we may not visit a country for a couple of years. So you just get a natural pent-up demand. So as we move shows overseas, even though it costs us a little bit more, because of the secular trends that I mentioned, the attendance and the ticket price, the economics are significantly stronger. It also provides us a rolling focus group of 52 weeks a year. We get to see what's hot with the fans 52 weeks a year. That is what gets translated then on the TV shows 52 weeks a year, because we see how people are reacting to characters, different story lines. About 20% of the Company's $526 million in revenue come from TB license fees, so it's roughly -- just over $100 million. Two thirds of those in the United States from the three license deals -- rights fee contracts that we have with USA, My TV Network and Sci Fi. About a third of it from our international TV deals. And last year we had a couple of significant international deals. One, we renewed our deal with our Indian TV partner, Ten Sports, at significantly better economics, which is pretty consistent within the WWE. We go in, get on TV, build up an audience, then our partners are successful, which means when it's time for us to renew, we are more successful. The way those TV deals are structured, they're usually two to three-year terms, contractual annual escalators, so you see significant growth. So even in the fourth quarter, where we had the recession really, really deepen, you still saw our TV rights -- revenue go up by about 16% year over year. On the pay-per-view side, it is about 20% of the Company's revenues. We did 14 events in 2008, just under 5 million buys. The economics there -- the way they work, every pay-per-view we have is about a $39.95 price to the consumer, other than WrestleMania, which is our number-one pay-per-view, and that retails for $54.95 to the consumer. That is a 50/50 revenue share with the cable and the satellite provider with WWE getting a 50% share and then we also pay an administrative fee as part of those deals. WrestleMania is roughly about 1 million of the 5 million buys, so WrestleMania for the Company is a premier economic event. And that will take place April 5th this year in Houston. So if there's anybody from Texas, I will make the same pitch. So if you real -- a live event gives you good flavor. If you have the opportunity to go see WrestleMania, it's on order of magnitude beyond that. As I said, 74,000 people in attendance last year. We are expecting something similar at Reliant Stadium, outdrew the Super Bowl last year. Hope to do the same thing next year. It really is an incredible event. Our consumer products business has been a big engine of historical growth. And from a platform perspective, we see it as a big engine of future growth. In '06 and '07, it grew at 24% a year. Last year it grew at about 15%. It certainly slowed a little bit in the fourth quarter. That business and the pay-per-view business were the two that were most impacted by the economy for WWE. Consumer products has three components to it. It has the licensing business. It has our DVD business, and it has our magazine or publishing business. The licensing business has -- itself has three components. Even though we have 150 licensees around the world, three global licenses make up about 70% of the revenue of our licensing business, and that is our toy license, our videogame license and our power license. On the digital media front, the revenue footprint there has three components. It has Internet advertising, online advertising, mobile, which is a combination of subscription fee or rights fee with a distributor as well as commerce ring tones and so on. And then e-commerce, where we sell product directly to the consumer through our WWEShop. On the advertising side, if you saw on the video, talked about the unique visitors. I touched on it. We have about 14 million unique visitors a month, just to give you a kind of perspective. I believe that's what the New York Times does a month. We also do about 440 million page views a month. So we have been incredibly successful at generating audience. Like a lot of people, operationally, one of the things we haven't been happy with is our monetization. We are up to -- we did in 2008 just over $12 million in online advertising. We think there's just a real big opportunity there. Right now, the premium remnant split for WWE is around 30% premium, 70% remnant. And if you look at a lot of other content sites, that is reversed. And the CPM's on the premium side are about 10 times the remnant. So we just think there's a lot of economic opportunity. Obviously, we are in tough cyclical times, but long-term, we think there is a lot of opportunity. We have done some things to strengthen the sales team. Brought over someone from Disney's digital business to lead the sales effort. So it is an area where we have been real happy with getting audience. We need to do a better job in monetizing it. I feel confident about the future there. And then finally, there is WWE Studios, which is our filmed entertainment business. We've released three movies, to date, theatricals. We released our first direct-to-video in January 6 of this year. We partnered with Fox behind [immune Alliance 3]. And then we are releasing our fourth theatrical on March 27, which is 12 rounds with John Cena. John was one of the guys that was predominantly featured in the film during the interview with a military cop. He is probably our number one superstar. He was the star of our biggest successful theatrical -- or our most successful theatrical, which was The Marine. He will star in 12 rounds. We have a lot of high hopes for John moving forward. The way the content works, it drives, obviously, everything that we do. There's always ebbs and flows in the content where people become hot. If you think back a few years, it was The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin were kind of at the epicenter. We think John Cena has that kind of potential. And we are real excited and kind of getting him out in as many venues as possible. So when we talk about earnings growth, we will talk about international, significant -- it's at about 18% CAGR over the last five years. It will drive the growth from -- when you take a geographic viewpoint of WWE's growth, it will drive the growth going forward. From a platform perspective, consumer products and digital media, consumer products has strong historical strength. We are very excited about the future there as we get into more and more countries. We have a new toy license partner in 2010. We have been with Jakks for the last seven years. We are transitioning to Mattel. We feel really good about Mattel both on -- three fronts -- their product development strength. They have much better distribution, and the economics because it was a competitive bid, were significantly higher than what we had enjoyed. So that license takes effect in January 1 of 2010. It's an example of an existing platform that just gets better because over time, as the brand performs, which it does across just about every platform we put it out there, the economics improve over time as well. And then finally, on the efficiency front, one of the things the Company -- the DNA of the Company is certainly entrepreneurial, top-line oriented, opportunity oriented. One of the things we probably lagged a little bit is on the discipline of execution. And kind of recognizing that after the second quarter in '08, we made a commitment to take $20 million of expenses out of the 2009 P&amp;L. This was before the economy really took a turn in the fourth quarter. So we had recognized that even after the first half of the year, our revenues were up 19% and our expenses were up about 18%. So that is not good enough. So we are going to focus on that as much as we are focusing on the top line. On the fourth-quarter call that we had about a month ago, I mentioned that every initiative around taking those $20 million has been executed, including about 40% of the $20 million coming from a staff reduction, which took place early January, about 10% headcount. So we feel we've got everything we need to be able to execute the strategy, so none of these changes kind of has hit our execution muscle. We just feel leaner. When we talk about international specifically, as I mentioned, '03 to '08, 18% CAGR, including about a 7% negative impact in '08 because of FX. Before '08, it had been growing over 20%. In '08, we did about 14%. In 2008, we did centralize our international organization. So as we execute, we are getting kind of smarter about how we want to do that. We have centralized resources. Still have six offices, but invested more in our central office in the UK. And what we have said, the Company doesn't give guidance, but about a year and a half ago it did come out and say its five-year plan between 2006 and 2011 was to grow the top line overall for the Company at about 10% a year and the bottom line at around 13%. And specifically the international, it meant doubling the international revenue from about $100 million in 2006 to about somewhere between $180 million and $200 million in 2011. And some of the more recent successes there, I mentioned India, the renewal of our TV deal. Spain is a really good example of how TV drives the economics here, domestically, but even more importantly as we're growing overseas. We have been in Spain for quite some time, but not the greatest TV deal. We were playing late at night, so we didn't have the audience that we thought we could. Over time, working with our partners, got on at a better time in Spain. Once we did that, we increased our audience by about 40%, so about a million households. And once we did that, we had significant growth in our consumer products business. So Spain went from the number 12 country in the WWE's portfolio to number three, right behind USA and UK, primarily because of the better TV coverage. We are hoping for something similar in Mexico. We have been in Mexico for a long time and had been in about 4 million households. Last year, we announced that we had reached a deal with the two biggest broadcasters in Mexico, TV Azteca and Televisa. So our RAW brands and our SmackDown brands, respectively, are on those two stations. We are now available to 20 million households and are now audiences of a million households each. So we are getting those kinds of ratings. And most weeks, we were beating the NFL during the NFL season in Mexico. So we are excited about the opportunity there. And that is why it is deals like that, India, Spain, Mexico, why international is such a big part of the Company's strategy. On the consumer products side, I mentioned it's three components -- licensing, home video and the magazine. On the licensing side, we have 150 licenses worldwide, as I mentioned, but three licenses are about 70% of the revenue in that business. We have the new deal with Mattel in 2010. On the DVD side, it is distributed by Genius Products. We do about 30 titles a year, 15 titles or about half the titles, correspond to a pay-per-view that we will do in the year. So we will do the pay-per-view and then release a DVD. And the other 15%, and this is kind of one of the great things about the Company owning its content, we have about 100,000 hours of video content. So we put out about 15 DVDs, utilizing that library, a year. We did about 4 million units in 2008 and have a really great partnership with the big-box stores, especially Wal-Mart. If you've been in a Wal-Mart recently, if you kind of put your eyes to looking for the WWE, we have -- I think we're up to 18 facings in Wal-Mart, which is pretty significant. And the presence is actually pretty stark when you actually go into the store and see how much WWE content there is. And then finally, on the magazine, we have about a circulation of 300,000. Probably one of the few profitable print entities. So our magazine relaunched in '06, where we had two separate magazines, combine them. So we are happy with the profitability that that product has been driving as well. On the digital media side, as I talked about, we have proven we can drive audience. The 14 million unique visitors; about half of those come from overseas. So what we are doing to expand overseas more and more because it's hard to monetize that part of the audience here domestically from an advertising standpoint, is we are developing licensing partnerships with local companies. So we have one in Portugal. You see an example of one in Mandarin, I believe, up on the screen. And over time, we hope to continue to get better economics domestically, and then through the licensing deals overseas, monetize that international audience. But the 14 million uniques and the 440 million page-throughs are just one of the many examples of when we put our content out, the folks who are into the brand just go out and seek it and pretty powerfully. So the investment highlights for the Company, the brand, number one and the way it manifests itself across geography and across different platforms. We have an attractive business and financial model. We believe not only in the top line, but a renewed discipline on the bottom line. I talked about the $20 million also in deference to the economy and the uncertainty they are. We have pushed back our CapEx. We had a significant CapEx that we had disclosed, about $70 million, around our TV studio to expand that, which is the core of where our products get produced and distributed from. We said we are going to delay that until the economy turns, that we had been planning between 2009 and 2011. And our number one objective continues to be to grow the cash-on-cash returns of the Company. Every individual product line is profitable and has great margins. And for us it is a matter of taking that content, finding new platforms and new countries and continuing to grow the cash-on-cash return. We have a really strong balance sheet. We had $200 million in cash on the balance sheet as of the end of December, and we have virtually no debt, just about $5 million on the mortgage in the headquarters. And then the last thing I will mention, you saw the video -- a couple of these folks were in the video, and they will be here tonight at the reception that starts at 5-15. So The Big Show, which is one of our biggest talents, 7 feet tall, 440 pounds, he was at the epicenter of one of the key story lines of last year's WrestleMania, the fight with Floyd Mayweather. So there had been a whole buildup of Floyd Mayweather and him and then they kind of duked it out at WrestleMania. He will be there and then Candice Michelle, part of the Go Daddy commercials and also one of our most popular divas. And I think one of the things I talk about going to a live event, you see the passion of the fans. When you get to meet the superstars, you get -- pretty quickly you understand why people are attracted. They're incredibly charismatic. There is a real kind of win-win relationship between the superstars and the company, and it kind of comes through. So hopefully you will be there tonight, not just for the three on three games, but to meet The Big Show and Candice. I think we have maybe a minute? One question.Questions and Answers","male","meanHispanic",89.54,"WWE","18-Mar-09",NA

"george barrios","George","george barrios","World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.","CFO"," Primarily -- well, I shouldn't say primarily. The second biggest bucket was on the marketing side. So one of the things we did is look at what our marketing spend was globally. Also looked at how much more we could leverage what we think is the most powerful marketing asset we have, is those five hours, soon to be six hours of prime time TV. We thought you know what, instead of paying others, we could utilize this a little bit better. So that was number two. And then frankly, it was a lot of marbleized fat throughout and it was a lot of little things. As I mentioned, the Company's DNA isn't and probably never will be about productivity and efficiency, but there's room for us to get a little bit better.","male","meanHispanic",89.54,"WWE","18-Mar-09",NA
