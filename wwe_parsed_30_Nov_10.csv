"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," This is Donna Goldsmith. She was named Chief Operating Officer of World Wrestling Entertainment in December of 2008 and also sits on the Board of Directors. Last year Forbes Magazine dubbed her one of the most powerful women in sports. WWE is known for its wrestling action through such franchises as SmackDown and Raw, and such athletes as Triple H and John Cena. Had $475 million in revenue in 2009 fiscal year. Its programming is watched by 14 million US viewers each week, and the company's website, WWE.com, attracts almost 13 million unique visitors a month. Donna joined WWE as Senior Vice President of Consumer Products in July 2000. After that she served as Executive Vice President of Consumer Products, overseeing the company's global merchandising licensing, book and magazine publishing, and DVD business, as well as the e-commerce site. She's also worked at the NBA and for Swatch watch USA and Revlon.

"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," So Donna, thank you for coming in. We will jump right in. I'll start off with a question I know, like when I talk to the analysts, people are wondering this. Now when Linda McMahon lost her bid for the U.S. Senate, people are wondering, is she going to come back to the WWE and win.","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," Well, everyone in the organization adores Linda McMahon. She is a wonderful, passionate, intelligent, amazing woman. But Linda has told that she spent her time at WWE, and it's on to the next -- whatever that may be. So although I hope we do see Linda, it will be more in a social capacity than it would be in a business capacity.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," So she's not coming back at all?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," She is not coming back to the organization.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," Can you talk more broadly -- turning to the business -- as to, from an economic perspective what you guys are seeing out there? Obviously, I'd looked at your results. I've noticed the ticket prices are going up, attendance is going down -- in the US -- and I just wanted to get a sense from you as to how you view things from an economic standpoint currently.","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," Well, here is the deal, Ben. We had -- what was very interesting is we had one of our best years ever last year, when so many other people were hit by the economic crisis. I think we almost had a little bit of a delayed effect. This year we've had some challenges. Some things continue to be very strong. Our consumer products business continues to be strong. We have a relatively new -- really new -- partnership with Mattel, who you may have read is our toy -- master toy license at this point. Their business continues to be extremely strong for us on the consumer goods side, both domestically and internationally. You mentioned the live events. What has actually happened with the ticket prices is they have not gone up, they've actually been modified on a market by market basis. And so what we do -- we'd like to call ourselves the best value in entertainment. So what we go out there and do is we look at the market. What market can or should we take the prices down in the lower priced seats because the people in the market can't afford it? Or maybe there's a market that does a little bit better, a larger DMA, where we say, the lowest priced tickets here can be $20 instead of perhaps $25, that they were the year before. What we have found though is that the higher ticket prices continue to sell out. And I think what -- that is no shock is that some people who still do have money want to have the best -- what they feel is the best -- experience by being in the very front of the arena. However, those that maybe can't afford it will still come to the show. They still want to entertain Johnny and Sally. But they're in the back. What I would say about that is that, yes, we've driven some numbers that way, but we still feel that the lower economic bracket has been hit and is being cautious. So I would say that on the live event side. On the pay-per-view side, we started out the year very strongly, actually raised our pay-per-view prices by $5 this year. And Royal Rumble, which is the first pay-per-view out of the gate for us in 2010, did extremely well. And there's been a couple ups and a couple downs. So we are finding some usual situations with our pay-per-view that we never saw before. Number one, I will tell you that we find people are now watching in groups, so that, again, using Johnny and Sally as my example, Johnny and Sally are going over to Fred's house, and there's 10 people watching instead of each of them buying the pay-per-view in the past. The other thing we're finding -- and this is no shock to anybody who knows our business -- is we are an attraction-based business. In the last five or six or even seven months, we have been hurt by many of our talent -- and it's all about our talent is our IP -- being out for injuries, for surprising retirement, for -- basically for injuries. We lost -- on and off this year we lost The Undertaker, Batista left us after WrestleMania, Shawn Michaels retired, CM Punk has been in and out. And that will affect our numbers. So it's not an economic situation as much as purely in a talent stand -- on a talent standpoint, and that has affected us. But again, going back to the consumer goods, it hasn't seemed to affect that business as much, on the toys, on the apparel side. Where we have felt some hit is on the DVD side, but so has everyone else. So is that an economy issue? Is it a -- is it just the state of business of that DVD business? I tend to think it's that. So it's a little of all those things have affected us. And I'm not saying the economy hasn't, but it's in the mix of everything.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," So as the economy strengthens, is it a simple matter of your guys' business will get better? Or --?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," I believe the -- well, there is no short answer. I believe the answer is yes, but we also need our talent to get healthy. We are also out there, as we always do -- we have a facility in Florida called Florida Championship Wrestling, and that is almost our AAA wrestling facility, where we bring talent to learn mic skills, to learn in-ring skills, character development -- because as you know, our guys are not only athletes, they have to be actors as well and have to have that charisma. And so we go down there often. We solicit talent all over the world to be part of that so that we can bring them up so they can be the next John Cena or the next Rock. So that's really important considering we lost a bunch of talent recently. It is important that we do find the new greatest talent. So we have got a new faction of bad guys called Nexus that we've been working with, who has been doing very, very well. Do you know who Nexus is? You're smiling over there. Do you watch the show at all? (laughter)","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"thomson reuters media","Thomson","thomson reuters reuters media",NA,NA," I'm just in awe of all the different names you're throwing out (laughter)","male",NA,NA,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," Wade Barrett, who came from Nexus -- he is actually -- British or Australian, you guys? British; right? British. Is one of our new top guys. Seamus from Ireland. So we have found these -- talent in all different places, and we bring them into our show. We let them get their feet wet, so to speak.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," I saw Seamus on TV last night.","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA

"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," He is pale (multiple speakers)","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," Well, I will tell you the funny story about Seamus is that he is very, very pale, and we were doing a photo shoot with him a couple of months ago, and he saw some of the outtakes, and he said, well, can't you make me whiter? We said, how much whiter can you be? You're about like this piece of paper here. So --","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," Yes, he is pretty ghostlike.","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," He's a little ghostlike, so that's part of his appeal.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," Right. Can you give me an update on the network? Obviously I went back and I read the comments from each call over the last four quarters, but as to where things stand right now, and I assume you guys still want to do that?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," It is something that we are absolutely looking into, Ben. It's a natural for us. We have got 100,000 hours of footage in our library, a combination of in-ring and very scripted entertainment that we have done. So much is in that library so that it makes perfect sense. We started doing the things we need to do to get ready for a library like digitizing some of the old footage, but we're not there yet. What we will do, probably after the first of the year is we'll start to get down to basics on this one and get down to business. My gut tells me in early discussions we've had is that we will go with the major baseball model, so we will be out there talking to distribution partners.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," You wouldn't mean where they take a stake?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," Yes, yes. Now again, that isn't carved in stone. We haven't made that final decision, but I think for us that is the best way to go. And as we galvanize the troops and get prepared for that, we're looking at what our HR needs would be, what our space needs would be. It's a whole game changer for us. It's a whole different ballgame. So I think -- unfortunately I don't have a lot of information for you now, but I think after the 1st of the year we will be in a better place there.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," Why the first of the year? And I ask that keeping in mind that people are waiting for the Comcast/NBC to go through, so there's just a natural supposition that maybe you're waiting for that and that is who's going to be the partner? Or --?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," That is not necessarily going to be the partner, although you'll want potentially Comcast to be one of your partners. It is really that we're still just doing the behind the scenes legwork. We're just not there yet. We need to finalize our business plan. And as the holidays start rolling in we're losing people from a resource standpoint, so it just make sense for us.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," And going back to the MLB model, that it would literally be potentially multiple carriers, each having a stake, like MLB did?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," That's what we're looking at now. But again, nothing is ever -- especially with the WWE we like to keep you on your toes. It is not carved in stone.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," And then what kind of like content would that network carry? And I ask that wondering, can a network work when you guys already are out there with seven hours of original programming on USA, Syfy, WGN America, you got another 15 in repeats. Can all that plus a network work?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," Those of the things we're looking at. I do -- we do believe that SmackDown and Raw will continue to air on either cable or network. Those are our -- the mainstays. Those are the drivers for us, and we need the reach and the distribution of national television -- probably. Again, I say probably because we're not there yet -- to get the numbers, and of course that's a lucrative business for us. Having said that, the other shows are up for discussion, as is a whole bunch of other potential shows that we're thinking about. Would we do a Diva's exercise program? Maybe. Would we do another Tough Enough like we did many years ago, which is how to make the next big wrestler? Would we do a pre and post show to SmackDown and to Raw, a live show, sort of a College GameDay? That's a consideration. We have movies now. We're in the movie business, so we're going to have a lot of content as well. Our talent has been all over different movies and in different television shows. Would we buy those rights to put them on there? So I'm not -- I'm sure we're not at a loss for what that could be, what that coverage and that content, I should say, would be. It's a question of what we end up putting on there, and those are the kinds of things we're working through right now.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," What do you think the target for a launch would be? MLB -- obviously it is a bigger sport -- launched with a record 50 million. What do you guys think you could launch with?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," I will take 50 million to launch. (laughter) I don't know that yet. I don't know, but I would be very happy with 50 million.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," Yes. And so you -- Vince said back in February that he hoped the network could be up and running in 18 months, which times out to about August 2011. Is that still the hope?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," That would be a little bit earlier than we -- at this point. It has taken us longer to sort of galvanize the troops and figure out where we're going, and we want to be thoughtful about it, and that is the way we do business. We don't jump. So my guess is more like the middle of 2012 or even beginning of 2013 before we're ready to go forward. We want to take the right approach.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"thomson reuters media","Thomson","thomson reuters reuters media",NA,NA," Have you asked the advertising and marketing community what they think about the network (multiple speakers)","male",NA,NA,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," Not really at this point because I want to be able to go to the outside community, be it the cable providers, be it the [parted] (multiple speakers) with information, and I just don't have enough. I need a programming grid to show them and some potential ideas on what the ratings could be. So at that point we will absolutely go there.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," So is there -- and I've seen estimates that it could cost up to $100 million over three years to launch and develop the network and analysts questioning whether that maybe puts the dividend at risk. So my question is, can you keep the dividend and fund the network launch? Can you do both?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," The answer to that is that we discuss the dividend every quarter, and we will continue to discuss the dividend with our Board, with our shareholders, so I don't have an answer for that question at this point, but it will come up again in our next call and the next one after that until we make the decision on where we're going, from both a -- expenditure standpoint and a payout for the dividend standpoint. So I don't know at this point.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," Do you think it is necessary -- you've got MLB Network, you've got NFL Network, USOC had in the past -- has looked at a network. Do you think for sports properties such as those and yourself that you have to have a network? What is the importance of these dedicated sports networks?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," Well, I think it is giving the consumers what they want to see, of course. Our fan base is rabid. And we, as I mentioned to you before, we have so much footage. I don't know if anybody else would have the kind of footage, that isn't just straight games, because we -- our stuff is so different, it is story, it's soap opera, it's action, it's a little of everything. So I think certainly for our fan base it is very appealing. It is also an extra appeal to those that may have lost the interest and they want to come back because they want to see the historical and they want to see the Rowdy Roddy Piper's and the Andre the Giant and the Superfly Snuka's that -- you really don't see that anymore. So we have all of that. It is also obviously financially very lucrative to go into that market if you can do it. And I think we have the wherewithal, we have the right people, we would hire up accordingly of course, and I think it just makes sense for us. I know I keep saying that. It seems so simplistic. And potentially the other sports say that too, although I would have comments on certain other sports and what my feeling would be on if they can make it or not, but I think for us it is just a natural thing to do.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," Because we had Chase Carey in yesterday, and his comment to me was something along the lines -- I don't know the exact words, but it was something along the lines of he just doesn't see how -- it could maybe work for a few top properties, but he just doesn't see how multiple properties can just keep rolling out these networks and they're all going to work.","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," Yes. Well, I get it from that perspective. From personal, our perspective at WWE we feel that it is a game changer and it could really work for us.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," Yes. How about -- can we talk about the overseas market? Last quarter it was 28% of your revenue, and I was wondering if you could talk about sort of where you see that going and what you have going on overseas.","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," Great. International business is so important to us. It is one of our top priorities -- and has been for the last couple of years. It continues to grow. And so you mentioned 28%. That has been about the rate it has been, a percentage of the whole. Of course I would like to grow the pie and then grow that piece of the pie with it. But right now where we stand is that Europe is a tremendous market for us. The United Kingdom is second to the United States as far as numbers go, the amount of television coverage, the amount we get paid for television coverage. We even bring our shows and do an actual live television show from there that gets satellite back to the States, twice a year out of the UK. I just came back actually, where we did it in Manchester for Raw and SmackDown. And that is because the fans are the closest to the North American fans. They get it. They want to touch and feel. They don't just want a live event, which is a little bit less bells and whistles than our television events. They want the real thing. And it works for us because we set up so many promotions, we have a retail program there, we have got a digital program, we do pay-per-view there. So it is a very mature but still very viable market for us. We have other markets in Europe that have been up and down. Spain -- we were doing great in Spain. You don't want to be though the next hot thing because then you go out at some point. It's you're only as good as your last dollar. And so what we have done is we have taken a little bit of a step back in Spain, looked for a new TV partner, which we just secured -- and Sarah can get you that partner later; I can't remember the name. But so in Spain we have got to build up again, but it's just starting to come back because we have secured television. And let me back up by telling you, Ben, how our sort of formulaic approach works, and then I will talk more about -- get back to your question. We go out there and we secure television in a market. We have an office in London where they focus on international. We have an office in Shanghai too. In Tokyo we have an office. But primarily the London office handles the world, with the exception of North America. They go out and they secure the television deals. Once those TV deals are up and running and our fans in the local market have a chance to feel what we're like, to get it, to watch it, the ratings are good, we will bring the -- well, a life event to that market. Again, I distinguish between a live event and a television program because a television program, we bring our producers, it's a much bigger thing, like I said, in the UK. But we go to -- we just came back from Italy, Germany -- where else did we go? All over the UK. We went to Birmingham. We go to Cardiff. And we bring our show there. It's the American show. It's not any different than you would see if you turn on SmackDown or Raw. But it's almost like we're America's greatest export, because interestingly enough, if you go up there, and let's say you're in Spain and you start to speak in Spanish, they don't want to hear it in Spanish, they want the real deal, they want the English performers speaking in English. And so -- I got off on a tangent there, but it's just to show what our formula is. So it is television, live events, we will bring our consumer products business there, we will make retail relationships, and we will bring our digital business. And in many cases we have local digital sites that we work with, with local partners. And it works. We've found it works. So the UK being the business biggest, Spain is big -- getting there. Germany has a lot of history with wrestling. They are very big on the past superstars and have always been very knowledgeable on WWE. France is huge for us, and it's funny because we did an interview in France, and they said, oh, you were an overnight sensation. We said, overnight sensation?

And we just came back in August from our first live event in China. In Shanghai we were part of the World Expo, which was a really cool thing. We had to go through -- jump through so many hoops to get in there because of the communist government, as you can imagine. But we brought our event as part of the Shanghai Expo. 8,000 people came to see our event. Fans came to see us. And it was amazing. It was amazing to see this very reserved audience that as we brought in our superstars, they were yelling, You suck. And then we were so taken back because they knew the bad guys (laughter) from the good guys. It was shocking. But it was so great because our talent resonated, and they loved it. And so now we are -- we have gotten in there. We made friends with the right people, and we hope to bring another event back there that -- this one was part of the Shanghai Expo so it wasn't a paid event for us, but the next time we go in we will bring -- we will do a regular paid event. And we're starting to do consumer goods. It is a tough market. The other markets that we're looking to expand in is Brazil. Brazil, we're not where we need to be. We had television a while back. We -- that deal ended, and we're out there actively pursuing Brazil now. What is interesting is our partnership with Mattel, they have a huge business in Latin America, and they have relationships with many of the top broadcasters in Brazil. So they said, let us go in with you, because we will support it with advertising. So it's a really great synergy with our partner.

"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," We've thought about it. We've thought, okay, we have to make new stars, and then we will bring them on the parallel tour. But they just -- from all the research we do, it is not what the fans want to see. Our fans want to see the re deal, and to them the real deal is what they see on SmackDown and Raw on Monday nights and what they see on Friday nights, and that is what they want to see. So I think the answer to that is no. We will -- now, you get talent once in a while from these countries as you go out there. The Great Khali is from India. When The Great Khali goes to India to do -- he's in -- he's on a television program now which is like the big brother type program for India. So he's been out of our program for a few weeks. He attracts -- it's funny. I think they hired Pamela Anderson to be in the house with him too, which is very random. But he attracts numbers. When we did a retail signing in India, there were like 5,000 people lined up at the crack of dawn. The thing started at three o'clock in the afternoon. So there are local talents. Seamus, when we go to Ireland, he's very, very popular. We will cultivate local talent, but it is an objective -- it is not an objective though to satisfy a different need other than bringing in more talent. It's not so we can do a parallel tour.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA

"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," We look. We look. But it's hard. It's a tough thing. You have to be good at athleticism. You have to act.

You don't really have as much of that over the top stuff anymore, and is that intentional? And we went back, and we thought about it, and we said, we -- to do this we need to have a very long-term view. We now had a short amount of time with SmackDown -- well, not a short amount; it was in its eighth year or something -- at PG, and we saw how that attracted a little bit of a different audience. And where we were challenged on the business side is we'd have sponsors and licensees coming to us and saying, we really like your product. Your reach and your distribution is amazing. And when we get down to it and we go to management, we can't get the buy-in because your content is just a little too edgy for us. Your numbers are a slam-dunk. But sorry, we can't do it. So what we did is we went back and we spoke to our writers -- because it is all about the writers who have to put this thing together; and Vince McMahon was involved, as was the management team -- and we said, can we do this and still be cool and water cooler talk and edgy but take it down just a little bit? And it's writing it differently. It is not -- ""taking down"" is not the right words. It is writing it differently. And everybody agreed that that would be the best thing to do. And lo and behold, here it is two years later. We have with us Mattel, as I mentioned before.

"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," It's -- no, it's been very, very positive. It's been the same kinds of things, where we've gotten more retailers, and even the partners we're talking to, other potential sponsor partners, who would not have spoken to us necessarily before. So I think it was very, very important in the US. As you mentioned, it is probably a little less important outside, but we're not going to have two different brand images, obviously, and it has been very, very good for us from the sponsor side, where M&amp;M/Mars is now a sponsor of ours with TWIX and various brands that they have, that Army National Guard has signed on, that ConAgra is a partner, Mattel I spoke about. So we've got really good blue chip companies -- 7-Eleven, Burger King just did a program with us. The quick serve restaurants would've never done anything in the past because just were uncomfortable. So it has been successfully globally for us.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," What's the -- you mentioned sort of the loss of talent because of injury or retirement and so forth. What is the traction for your next wave of stars?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," We're there. We're looking there. As I said, we have got The Nexus Group. We've got Wade Barrett. We've got Seamus. We have got some -- Cody Rhodes, some other high flyers, some young guys. But that is a challenge. It is a challenge. We've got some, and we're -- we test the waters. We were so lucky because every single night we're out there, we have a focus group. Every single night. And so if you're going to Des Moines to put on a show and you put the guys out there and you have it somewhat scripted, and applause -- great. Boos? We will take it, because it is resonating. Silence? It's not working. So what we do is we go back and we rewrite, and that has a lot to do, not only the storyline but the talent portraying the storyline. What's so interesting about our business, as we have -- and those learn who come in from other businesses very quickly, is that we make changes on the fly. We are extremely flexible. So let's say -- I was using the Des Moines example. Let's say we had a pay-per-view on a Sunday in Des Moines that just, from a feel in the audience, it didn't perform the way we thought it would. Monday afternoon they're rewriting for Monday night. They're rewriting so those characters and that storyline will resonate with the public. And that's what we do, because it is all about keeping our fans engaged and the talent resonating with the audience. And if we don't do that, what have we got? So I don't have a really good answer for that, other than we are working on it, and there's got to be traction quickly, because we need it. And we've still got John Cena, who is relatively young. He's been with us -- god, for probably seven or eight years now, and he is a huge star, and he loves the business and will do anything for us. And that's another thing I wanted to mention, that our talent is so wonderful and so articulate, to bring them to a Wal-Mart managers meeting is something we do often. They understand the business side of things, which is so different than any NBA players. I wouldn't take the guy, the 12th guy on the bench to -- with me to Wal-Mart, because I wouldn't know what would come out of that. But these guys are very, very good at that. That is part of their training.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," Right. What -- you've -- the -- we mentioned the Mattel toys. Through nine months you're almost double what you were last year. How do you maintain that?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," Well, that's the magical question. Well, we retain it by then making continually better and good products, and they are not the number one toy company for nothing, they are very, very good, very, very creative. They come to us with ideas every single day, to our consumer goods people, so that is important, that the product looks good, feels good. We keep our talent involved with the product too. We do show and tell. And you would be surprised. They come up with great ideas. Hey, you didn't do my move right. Let's call this new -- or you -- not that you didn't do it right, you didn't capitalize on it, so let's come out with a product that is the blah, blah, blah move -- whatever it is. So we do that. We have established relationships with retailers that we had that may not be in the toy sector, but we get Mattel into those doors so they can bring their goods in. We sell the product at venue. We didn't do that very much before, but they'll create something specifically for venue, which is a little bit lower price point. And again, it is fresh and new and different. And at this point I also think collectors are buying a lot of product because they had the product from the past licensee, and collection of these action figures is so important to their collecting and their future sending their kid to college. They think that's what they're going to send their kids to colleges on. The other thing I would add about that is Mattel's products, there is an array of products. The former licensee was more about action figures, but these guys are doing games and role-playing and all sorts of fun stuff to bring in the younger fan too. And now we're working with Mattel and talking about other things. Should we be doing animation, an animation series? And there's so -- like Hasbro recently did with Discovery? Should we be talking about that with them? Should it be part of our network plans? That's why I'm saying it is not cut and dried for our network in the 1st of the year.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"ben klayman","Ben","ben klayman","Thomson Reuters","Media"," Sure. The film unit -- you guys have sort of changed your model to sort of this self distribution, rather than hook up with someone and have them distribute. And I'm just wondering how fast you will be profitable under this model. And are you going to ramp up a movie output under the model?","male","meanwhite",77.129,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," The deal is -- the deal works like this. In the past, as you said, Ben, we worked with Fox, we worked with Lions Gate, and those -- it was a typical films distribution. This is different now. What we're doing is, as you mentioned, we're working with Goldwyn. Samuel Goldwyn Films does our theatrical distribution. Now, our theatrical distribution is very limited. It could be anywhere from 175 screens. It could be 10 screens. It's just to get it out there. It's marketing, more than anything else. And then we go out there with the DVD product. And we have very, very good -- as I mentioned before -- retail relationships. So our first movie, Legendary, which starred Patricia Clarkson and Danny Glover and John Cena -- it was a good cast, and it was very atypical to what anyone would think the WWE would be -- would do. It was a family coming-of-age movie, nothing slamming, pow'ing and no ring action. It was nothing like that, other than there was wrestling, but it was high school wrestling. And the way that the windowing worked is that we shrunk the window considerably down from the movie, which was in, like I said, limited screens, to releasing the DVD exclusively. That one was exclusively released at Wal-Mart. They took enough product, equal to a $10 million movie premiere, or a $10 million, I should say, expenditure on a movie. We were nothing like that. Our movies are in the $5 million to $7 million range. And so far our numbers at Wal-Mart -- because it is exclusively through the end of the year at Wal-Mart -- are very, very strong. So we're following the numbers we need to do to make a considerable profit. At the same time, our international staff, the team based in London I mentioned, is out there selling it, DVD; they're selling it on pay-per-view if they have pay-per-view in the local markets; on video on demand. So all hands on deck to make this thing work. Now, the second movie, Knucklehead, is more of a young, silly -- the story is it's a 35-year-old orphan played by our Big Show, who had never been able to get out of the orphanage, and by accident he sets fire to the orphanage, so now he has to do something to raise money, and so he goes out there and does some bare-knuckle fighting. And also starting in that movie is Mark Feuerstein, from Royal Pains; Melora Hardin, from --","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA

That was already in a limited theatrical again. I think we went seven theaters. And straight to DVD, and this time we went across the board. We went many retailers. So that will take a little bit while to see -- a little bit longer -- because we just released the movie at retailers I think November 9th -- to see how the numbers are there. But so far so good. It's hard to say. Will I make the money? I hope to. Again, they are out there selling it internationally too. The next movie after those two, which now we will take a little hiatus, is in February, and it is called The Chaperone, and it is with Triple H, who is one of our top wrestlers, along with Ariel Winter, who is the little -- one of the little girls from one of the most popular shows now, Modern Family, the little girl with the glasses. I don't -- I watched the show once or twice, and she's a pistol. And in the movie she's a real pistol. I met her, and she's adorable. And she's in that a movie. That's a real fun kids, tooth fairy-ish, game plan-ish type movie. So with that we might go a broader distribution (multiple speakers)","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA

"donna goldsmith","Donna","donna goldsmith","World Wrestling EntertainmentInc.","COO"," The game just came out recently, so my understanding is that it is selling very well in a tough economy. Maybe this weekend -- I'm waiting for information from how everything we do did this weekend, because that is key as you're going into Christmas. So I can't exactly answer that yet, but we have we have high hopes for it. We also are coming out -- or THQ is coming out with a game in March '11. For the first time they're coming out with a game called WWE All Stars, which is more like an arcade style game. It's not that hard to play for people like me. It's sort of over the top, and it brings together two generations of WWE superstars. So you can have John Cena competing against Rowdy Roddy Piper. You can pick who you want. And it's -- they -- it was funny because they put me in a room knowing that I'm a dope when it comes to that stuff, and it was really fun. It was really -- I don't want to say easy, because easy would make it boring, but it was challenging enough for someone like me to try to do it. And it's offering a game to yet another demo for us, maybe the [laps] viewer, maybe the old -- the laps game player, the older game player. So our deal with THQ now is another seven years. We have a long-term deal with them. They are a great partner to work with. They're in our offices constantly working with our team on new concepts. We're looking at a game that has been out there in discussions called Brawl, which is going to be sort of anime. It's hard to say animation when you're talking about game playing, but it could potentially turn into some kind of animation property as we keep discussing it. So they are a good partner, and they're -- financially they're good, they're a good part of our business.","female","meanwhite",87.0415,"WWE","30-Nov-10",NA
